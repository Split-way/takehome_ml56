# Take Home Assignment

## Overview:

You’re a Software Developer working for a highly sophisticated retail
company called ABC Co. The machine learning team has recently developed a
new ML model for text generation which they would like to use as the engine in
their customer support chatbot, named “Jarvis”. You have now been asked to
develop a lightweight chatbot UI that utilizes their new ML algorithm.

## The Model:
* GPT-2 (the smallest version that is hosted on HuggingFace)

## Requirements:
* A chatbot UI that allows users to chat with the GPT-2 model
* Any questions asked by the user are turned into embeddings and stored in
a Vector DB (out of scope, but these embeddings are then queried with the
FAQ database for potential quick resolutions for the user)

## Deliverables:
We would like you to build a lightweight web app for the customer support
chatbot. The focus of this assignment is on your ability to take artifacts passed
from other teams and put them into a production-like environment.

In addition, please include as part of the README.md of your code base,
a section discussing how you might containerize the app and deploy this in a
full-blown production environment that uses proper container orchestration.

To be mindful of your time, this project should not take more than 2-3 hours
to complete.

## Submission:
To submit your assignment, please reply to this email with either a GitHub,
GitLab, or Google Drive link to your code.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Good luck!
